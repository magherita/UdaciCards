# UdaciCards Project

UdaciCards is a mobile application (Android) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

It is built using React Native CLI (`npx react-native init`) and `react hooks + Context API` for state management.

It uses `AsyncStorage` for data storage.

## TL;DR

To run the app:

- install all project dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`
- cd into the root of the app and start the `Metro` via a terminal using the command `npx react-native start`
- then in a separate terminal (say that of `VSCode`) execute the command `npx react-native run-android`

## Requirements

- Ensure you have an android emulator where the app can run
